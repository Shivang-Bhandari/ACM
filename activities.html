Only 2 of our students (Rajat Sharma and Shubham Singla) got a chance to visit the site. In the first section, they went to Class 1 Zone, where they were shown how the fabrication of a wafor takes place which gave them the idea about the initial step for an IC production and how the base layer deposition, electrical layer deposition and sacrificial removal process takes place. In the second section students were taken to the R&D Department. Here, they were shown designing process of the chip on E-dac. Here they came to know about various techniques to design an IC through VHDL, error-rate possible while fabricating a wafor. Next they were taken to de-ionised water plant where they were the process to de-ionise the water and to bring down the resistivity of the water upto the the required level. It is an essential requirement for the cleansing of the wafor to nullify the error rate. Lastly they were taken to class 100 they were shown the packaging process of an IC by soldering or by manual installment of a wafor the package. The head of department also told them how they planned to upgrade the fab after IBM backed out the deal and how SCL was undergoing an upgrade to produce chips of 0.18 micrometers from tower semiconductor, Israel. The students interacted with the officials and gained a lot of knowledge which will be useful for them in their academics.</p></div></div><div class="blog-item"><div class="blog-item-date"> <span class="date-num">9-10</span>Oct</div><h2 class="blog-item-title animate">Automatic Speech Recognition Workshop</h2><div class="blog-item-body"><p> Speech Processing is a scientific discipline as well as a technology frontier with immense applications. The treatment of speech signal processing requires an initial grounding in digital signal processing. On one side of the spectrum is the speech and languae sciences, such as linguistics, phonetics and psychoacoustics and on the other side are the signal processing thoery and pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. This leads to enhanced human-human and human-machine communication systems, such as speech and audio coding, automatic speech and speaker recognition, speech synthesis, speech enhancement etc. Pursuit of such wide ranging research and development demands a broad base of fundamental knowledge, as well as mastering of clever algorithms and techniques.</p></div></div><div class="blog-item"><div class="blog-item-date"> <span class="date-num">10</span>Oct</div><h2 class="blog-item-title animate">Industrial Visit : Pushpa Gujra Science City</h2><div class="blog-item-body"><p> ACM student chapter organized industrial visit to Pushpa gujral science city, Kapurthala on 10th October 2015. 5 faculty member of CSE department and 58 students of ACM, IEEE, IEI, B&B and google club visited the site.
